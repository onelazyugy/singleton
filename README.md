# singleton
spring boot and singleton pattern

# Sample API
- set the data for the singleton object via POST request (http://localhost:8080/singleton/setData)
- get the data from the singleton object via GET request (http://localhost:8080/singleton/getData)
- the GET should return whatever was set in the /setData request
